Tools, languages, etc. I've used:

- write SQL queries, create and manipulate databases, tables and table content
- connect to database from Visual Studio projects directly
- work as part of a team, use branches, merge/rebase branches in Sourcetree, resolve merge conflicts using Visual Studio Code
- notice when ChatGPT is writing unhelpful nonsense :D
